[Code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

Feel free to open an issue on GitHub or submit a PR â€” every contribution is welcomed!

If you wish to add a major new feature or modify public APIs, the point to start is [Celesta Improvement Process](https://github.com/courseorchestra/cip).
There we discuss new major/compatibility breaking proposals before the implementation. In order to initiate such a discussion you might want to submit a new CIP.
